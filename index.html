        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p> I am a physiotherapist with a passion for problem-solving and coding.</p>
        <p> I have been learning backend development for a whil and has since developed a passion for it. During my learning period I have experienced and learned programming languages such as Python, Javascript, and Typescript. I have also learned the basics of HTML and CSS. I have advanced my learning and worked with runtime environments like Nodejs, and frameworks such as Django, ExpressJS, and FastAPi.</p>
        <p> I enrolled in Altschool in 2024 and got admitted into the backend engineering program. I am currently undergoing a one-year training in backend development and looking to grow my skills to the extent I can have jobs and build projects that solve real-life problems and make a difference.</p>

        <h2>Why I joined the Altschool Program</h2>
        <p> I joined Altschool Africa when I realized that I kept learning in a start-stop manner. Everytime I pick up coding, I learn a lot, only to get to a point where I don't know what to learn next or how to use the skill I have learned. Because of this I felt a school was the best solution. Somewhere that I can have a roadmap in my learning journey and enjoy several other benefits that come with being a part of the establishment.</p>
